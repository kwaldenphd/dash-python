    "1. We may want to create an interactive web application featuring a `plotly` figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We see this kind of interactivity in dashboard-style interfaces, like the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dashboard](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We can use the `dash` web application framework in combination with `plotly` to \"publish\" a figure as an interactive web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `dash` was developed by the Plotly team and released in 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In addition to a limited free open-source version, Plotly also offers paid enterprise versions of `dash`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What exactly is `dash`?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. \"Dash is a productive Python framework for building web analytic applications. Written on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, Dash is ideal for building data visualization apps with highly custom user interfaces in pure Python. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data in Python. Through a couple of simple patterns, Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols that are required to build an interactive web-based application. Dash is simple enough that you can bind a user interface around your Python code in an afternoon. Dash apps are rendered in the web browser. You can deploy your apps to servers and then share them through URLs. Since Dash apps are viewed in the web browser, Dash is inherently cross-platform and mobile ready\" (`plotly`, [Introduction to Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction)).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. For those familiar with RStudio's [Shiny package](v) (designed to build interactive web applications from within the R/RStudio programming environment), `dash` was originally pitched as the equivalent package for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Though originally built exclusively for `Python`, `dash` has since released versions for R/RStudio and Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. For more background on `dash`:\n",

    "11. To install `dash`:\n",
    "- using `pip`: `pip install dash`\n",
    "- in Jupyter notebook using `pip`: `pip install jupyter-dash`\n",
    "- in Jupyter notebook using `conda`: `conda install -c conda-forge -c plotly jupyter-dash`"

    "\n",
    "58. The application inputs and outputs are described using the `@app.callback` decorator, similar to the layout and component declarations covered previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "59. The decorator instructs `dash` to call this function whenever the input value changes, so the output components are updated accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "60. What you name the function arguments is up to you, as long as the names in the function definition match the names in the callback.\n",
    "\n",
    "61. The `@app.callback` decorator references components described in `app.layout`.\n",
    "\n",
    "62. Thus the component names in `@app.callback` need to reflect the component names used with `app.layout`.\n",
    "\n",
    "63. In this example, those component names are `my-input` and `my-output`.\n",
    "\n",
    "64. We see those names set using the `id` parameter with `app.layout`, and reflected in the callback.\n",
    "\n",
    "65. The `@app.callback` decorator should always come immediately before the `def` function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "66. For more on function decorators in Python: [`python`, PEP 318 -- Decorators for Functions and Methods](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/)\n",
    "\n",
    "67. In `dash` syntax, application inputs and outputs are treated as component properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "68. In this example, the `my-input` component is set to take the input as its `value`, and `my-output` is set to reflect the `my-input` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "69. Whenever an input property changes (in this example characters in the input box change), the callback function is automatically called.\n",
    "\n",
    "70. `dash` provides the function with the new input value and updates the output component property.\n",
    "\n",
    "71. Note that we had to import `from dash.dependencies import Input, Output`, which is different than `dash_core_components.Input`.\n",
    "\n",
    "72. Taken together, this functionality is called ***reactive programming***.\n",
    "\n",
    "73. The keyword arguments used to describe each component become incredibly important when setting up callback functions.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
